I started by designing the main banner, setting a full-screen background image with a dark gradient overlay. Next, I added a navigation bar at the top, which includes a logo and menu items like 'Home,' 'Bedroom,' and 'Kitchen.' The logo aligns to the left, while the menu items are evenly spaced and change color when hovered over, adding an interactive touch. Below the navbar, I added a title and a tagline, followed by 'Book' and 'Enquire' buttons (which also change color when hovered over)that lead users to a contact section. The contact section collects essential details like the user's name, email, and address.
